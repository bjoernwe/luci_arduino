# Luci Light

![Luci light blinking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjoernwe/luci_arduino/master/luci.gif)

This is a little proof-of-concept to reproduce the hallucinatory effects of a ~$30k [Lucia](http://www.lucialightexperience.com/) lamp with an Arduino microcontroller and some programmable LEDs ([Adafruit NeoPixels](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168)).

This repository contains the C++ code for the Arduino, which translates simple serial inputs to adjust brightness, frequency, and color of the blinking LEDs.

There's a corresponding Python GUI for the serial communication at https://github.com/bjoernwe/luci_arduino_client/.
